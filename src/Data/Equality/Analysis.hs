E-class analysis, which allows the concise expression of a program analysis over
the e-graph.

An e-class analysis resembles abstract interpretation lifted to the e-graph
level, attaching analysis data from a semilattice to each e-class.

The e-graph maintains and propagates this data as e-classes get merged and new
e-nodes are added.

Analysis data can be used directly to modify the e-graph, to inform how or if
rewrites apply their right-hand sides, or to determine the cost of terms during
the extraction process.
