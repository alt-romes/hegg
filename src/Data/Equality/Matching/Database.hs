-- can still have an 'Data.String.IsString' instance for variable patterns by hashing the
-- string into a unique number.

-- As described in the paper:
-- Generic join requires two important performance bounds to be met in order for its own run time
-- to meet the AGM bound. First, the intersection [...] must run in 𝑂 (min(|𝑅𝑗 .𝑥 |)) time. Second,
-- the residual relations should be computed in constant time, i.e., computing from the relation 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦)
-- the relation 𝑅(𝑣𝑥 , 𝑦) for some 𝑣𝑥 ∈ 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦).𝑥 must take constant time. Both of these can be solved by
-- using tries (sometimes called prefix or suffix trees) as an indexing data structure.
