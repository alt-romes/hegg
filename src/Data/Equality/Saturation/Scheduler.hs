Definition of 'Scheduler' as a way to control application of rewrite rules.

The 'BackoffScheduler' is a scheduler which implements exponential rule backoff
and is used by default in 'Data.Equality.Saturation.equalitySaturation'

-- | A 'Scheduler' that implements exponentional rule backoff.
--
-- For each rewrite, there exists a configurable initial match limit. If a rewrite
-- search yield more than this limit, then we ban this rule for number of
-- iterations, double its limit, and double the time it will be banned next time.
--
-- This seems effective at preventing explosive rules like associativity from
-- taking an unfair amount of resources.
